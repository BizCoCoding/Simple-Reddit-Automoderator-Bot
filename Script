  Thank you for posting!

  If your post is removed it is because reddit automatically marks your post as spam, just leave it as your post will be approved in at the most a 
  day afterwards anyways unless I'm on holiday or contact the mods if you really want to. Please also modmail us if you have ideas on how to grow 
  the community or if you would like to be a mod - however the latter requires an active reddit account and over 500 karma.
  
  Many Thanks,
  
  The Moderator Team
